# Youtube-Search-word-by-time-stamp
Haven't we always desired to reach at that very specific moment in the youtube video and get the specific content we are looking for? Like watching a 10 hours tutorial but you want only those portions of the video which mentioned about string splitting.
Well that is VERY MUCH possible with simple python code automation!! This simple code does what we were looking for. All we have to do is pass a video link or a list of many youtube vieo links and also give the specific word(s) we are looking, the rest of the work will be done by the algo, all we need to do is seat back and enjoy.
Here in the test video the word 'Lambda' as showcased in Google IO 2021 and 'Duplex' mentioned in Google IO 2018 is searched by the algo and it plays exactly where the words were mentioned!
Disclaimer : The algo uses youtube live captions and transcription API, so the videos with not live captions can't be used at the moment.
