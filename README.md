# Youtube-Search-word-by-time-stamp
Haven't we always desired to reach at that very specific moment in the youtube videos and get the specific content we are looking for without any hassle? Like watching a 10 hours tutorial but you want only those portions of the video which mentioned about string splitting.

Well that is VERY MUCH possible with simple python code automation!! This simpl code does what we were looking for. All we have to do is pass a video link or a list of many youtube video links and also give the specific word(s) we are looking for, the rest of the work will be done by the algo, we'll just seat back and enjoy.
Here in the test video the word 'Lambda' as showcased in Google IO 2021 and 'Duplex' mentioned in Google IO 2018 are searched by the algo and it plays exactly at those time stamps where the words were mentioned! Infact one can search among multiple videos and look for the key words they are looking for.

Disclaimer : The algo uses youtube live captions and transcription API, so the videos with no live captions can't be used at the moment.
